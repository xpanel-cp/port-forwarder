# XForwarder
To tunnel traffic (port forwarding) on your first server to your second server, run the following command:<br>

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpanel-cp/port-forwarder/main/xforwarder.sh --ipv4)
```
<br>
You can easily tunnel your traffic to the second server using Iptables.<br>
For those who use XPANEL Singbox protocols, you can easily transfer traffic from all ports to your second and main server by running the above command on the first server and selecting number 2.<br>

Tuic = UDP,TCP<br>
Hysteria2 = UDP,TCP<br>
